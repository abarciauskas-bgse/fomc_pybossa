The application uses **FOMC minutes** text data.

The objective of this application is to find a threshold to qualifies 2 pairs of statements as redundant. Using human decisions on redundancy of pairs of sentences, a match is made with the similarity score determined by an algorithm. This will determine a threshold. Pairs of sentences with a score above this threshold will be classified as redundant.

The application provides three simple answers as action buttons:

  * Yes
  * No and
  * I don't know
